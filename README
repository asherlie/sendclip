sendclip allows users to send text directly to the
clipboards of other machines

config file `.sendclip` in the user's home directory
will be used to specify any number of IP addresses of
recipients
if no config file exists, sendclip will only attempt to
send to the recipient argument

sendclip depends on github.com/jtanx's incredible
libclipboard, as well as my pooler library for
threadpool support

NOTE: <required>, {optional}
usage:
  ./sc <text> {ip} - send <text> to {ip}'s clipboard
                   | as well as all ip addresses set
                   | in config file
  ./sc             - await connections

  ./sc -help       - print this usage information
